# Next.js 16 Upgrade & Optimization Guide

## Upgrade Summary

Successfully upgraded from Next.js 15 to Next.js 16 with the following changes:

### Package Updates

- **next**: `^15.5.4` → `^16.0.0`
- **fumadocs-core**: `15.8.2` → `16.0.5`
- **fumadocs-mdx**: `12.0.1` → `13.0.2`
- **fumadocs-ui**: `15.8.2` → `16.0.5`

### Configuration Optimizations

#### next.config.mjs
- Moved `optimizePackageImports` from experimental to stable
- Added more packages to optimize: `@radix-ui/react-icons`, `framer-motion`
- Added `cacheMaxMemorySize` for better memory management (50MB)
- Kept compression and security headers

#### Root Layout (app/layout.tsx)
- Enhanced font optimization with `variable` and `adjustFontFallback`
- Added `metadataBase` for proper URL resolution
- Improved viewport configuration

### API Route Optimizations

Added route segment configs to key API routes for better performance:

1. **Dynamic Routes** (force-dynamic):
   - `/api/posts/route.ts` - POST endpoint
   - `/api/search/route.ts` - Search with real-time data
   - `/api/user/me/route.ts` - User session data

2. **Static Routes** (force-static with revalidation):
   - `/api/blog/posts/route.ts` - Public blog posts (60s revalidation)

### Bug Fixes

Fixed circular structure error in `/api/blog/posts/route.ts`:
- Changed return from `blogPosts` (schema) to `posts` (query result)

## Next.js 16 Features Utilized

1. **Optimized Package Imports**: Automatic tree-shaking for large icon libraries
2. **Enhanced Caching**: Better memory management with `cacheMaxMemorySize`
3. **Route Segment Config**: Explicit control over route behavior
4. **Font Optimization**: Improved font loading with fallback adjustments

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced bundle size through optimized package imports
- Better caching strategy for static content
- Improved font loading performance
- Memory-efficient cache handling

## Node.js Requirements

⚠️ **Important**: Next.js 16 requires Node.js >= 20.9.0
Current warnings indicate Node.js 18.19.1 is being used. Upgrade recommended:

```bash
# Using nvm
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

# Or update your system Node.js
```
