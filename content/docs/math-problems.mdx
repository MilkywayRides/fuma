# Mathematical Problems & Solutions

This page contains various mathematical problems with detailed solutions to help you understand different mathematical concepts.

## Algebra Problems

### Problem 1: Quadratic Equation
**Question:** Solve the quadratic equation: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$

**Solution:**
We can solve this using the factoring method:

1. Look for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5
2. These numbers are -2 and -3
3. Factor: $(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$
4. Therefore: $x = 2$ or $x = 3$

**Answer:** $x = 2, 3$

### Problem 2: System of Linear Equations
**Question:** Solve the system:

```math
\begin{cases}
2x + 3y = 7 \\
x - y = 1
\end{cases}
```

**Solution:**
Using substitution method:

1. From equation 2: $x = y + 1$
2. Substitute into equation 1: $2(y + 1) + 3y = 7$
3. Simplify: $2y + 2 + 3y = 7$
4. Combine: $5y = 5$
5. Therefore: $y = 1$
6. Substitute back: $x = 1 + 1 = 2$

**Answer:** $x = 2, y = 1$

## Calculus Problems

### Problem 3: Derivative
**Question:** Find the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1$

**Solution:**
Using the power rule: $\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$

```math
f'(x) = 3 \cdot 3x^2 - 2 \cdot 2x + 5 \cdot 1 - 0 = 9x^2 - 4x + 5
```

**Answer:** $f'(x) = 9x^2 - 4x + 5$

### Problem 4: Integration
**Question:** Evaluate $\int (2x + 3) dx$

**Solution:**
Using the power rule for integration:

```math
\int (2x + 3) dx = \int 2x dx + \int 3 dx = 2 \cdot \frac{x^2}{2} + 3x + C = x^2 + 3x + C
```

**Answer:** $x^2 + 3x + C$

## Geometry Problems

### Problem 5: Area of Triangle
**Question:** Find the area of a triangle with vertices at A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(7, 2).

**Solution:**
Using the coordinate formula for triangle area:

```math
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}|x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2)|
```

Substituting the coordinates:
```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{Area} &= \frac{1}{2}|1(6 - 2) + 4(2 - 2) + 7(2 - 6)| \\
&= \frac{1}{2}|1(4) + 4(0) + 7(-4)| \\
&= \frac{1}{2}|4 + 0 - 28| \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 24 = 12
\end{aligned}
```

**Answer:** 12 square units

## Trigonometry Problems

### Problem 6: Trigonometric Identity
**Question:** Prove that $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$

**Solution:**
This is the fundamental trigonometric identity. We can prove it using the unit circle:

1. Consider a point P(x, y) on the unit circle with radius 1
2. By definition: $\cos\theta = x$ and $\sin\theta = y$
3. Since P is on the unit circle: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
4. Substituting: $\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1$

Therefore: $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ ✓

### Problem 7: Solving Trigonometric Equation
**Question:** Solve $2\sin x = 1$ for $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$

**Solution:**
1. Divide both sides by 2: $\sin x = \frac{1}{2}$
2. Find angles where sine equals $\frac{1}{2}$:
   - $x = \frac{\pi}{6}$ (30°)
   - $x = \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$ (150°)

**Answer:** $x = \frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{5\pi}{6}$

## Statistics & Probability

### Problem 8: Mean and Standard Deviation
**Question:** Find the mean and standard deviation of the dataset: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

**Solution:**

**Mean:**
```math
\bar{x} = \frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
```

**Standard Deviation:**
1. Find deviations from mean: {-4, -2, 0, 2, 4}
2. Square the deviations: {16, 4, 0, 4, 16}
3. Find variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16}{5} = \frac{40}{5} = 8$
4. Standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.83$

**Answer:** Mean = 6, Standard Deviation = $2\sqrt{2}$

### Problem 9: Probability
**Question:** A bag contains 3 red balls, 4 blue balls, and 5 green balls. What is the probability of drawing a red ball?

**Solution:**
1. Total number of balls = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
2. Number of red balls = 3
3. Probability = $\frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$
4. P(Red) = $\frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25$

**Answer:** $\frac{1}{4}$ or 25%

## Number Theory

### Problem 10: Prime Factorization
**Question:** Find the prime factorization of 84.

**Solution:**
We divide by prime numbers starting from the smallest:

```math
\begin{aligned}
84 &= 2 \times 42 \\
42 &= 2 \times 21 \\
21 &= 3 \times 7 \\
7 &= 7 \times 1
\end{aligned}
```

Therefore: $84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7$

**Answer:** $84 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 7$
